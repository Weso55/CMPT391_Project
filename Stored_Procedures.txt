So you can only run these one at a time like when Creating Views. just copy and paste them in sql management studio

CREATE PROCEDURE Sign_in
@username varchar(50)
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT Name
    FROM Students
    Where Student_ID = @username;
END;

CREATE PROCEDURE Enrolled_Startup_Data
@id Int
AS
BEGIN
    SELECT *
    FROM Enrolled
    Where Student_ID = @id;
END;
